# Nail Salon Simulator

I currently work as a nail technician and I wanted to create a Java program that simulates a typical day in the nail salon.



Java felt like a natural choice for this project because it naturally fits an object-oriented design.
As I continue working toward my degree, this project gives me space to practice and apply those concepts outside of class.
